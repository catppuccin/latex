<h1>Beamer theme gallery</h1>
<p>Welcome to the beamer (latex) theme gallery.</p>

<p>
Every time I wanted to pick a theme for a presentation I ended up spending a lot of time. That was because I didn't know the themes and for each one I had to recompile the whole presentation and see how it looked.

I searched for samples of those themes but found none. That's why I did this. I hope it might be useful to somebody else.

<h2>Navigate</h2>

<ul><li><a href="index_by_theme.html">Show by theme</a></li>
<li><a href="index_by_color.html">Show by color</a></li>
<li><a href="index_by_flavor.html">Show by flavor</a></li>
<li><a href="index_by_theme_and_color.html">Show by theme and color</a> (might be a little slow)</li></ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>

The presentation used (&copy; by Till Tantau) is under the GPL and you can get it <a href="template.tex.tmpl">here</a> (and also in a lot of other places). This bunch of pages have been generated using three simple bash scripts. In case someone is interested here they are: <a href="build_preview.sh">build_preview.sh</a> <a href="build_web.sh">build_web.sh</a>. But beware that those scripts directly do not generate these pages (some minimal human intervention is needed).
